The Problem
The error message from Composer tells you that the spatie/image package requires a specific PHP extension called ext-exif. This extension is used to read and write EXIF metadata from image files (such as the camera model, date, and time). It's not present on your server, so Composer cannot install the package successfully.

The Solution
You need to install the missing PHP extension and then restart your web server. The exact command depends on your server's operating system.

Step 1: Install the ext-exif extension
If you are on an Ubuntu or Debian server:

Bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php-exif
If you are on a CentOS or Red Hat server:

Bash

sudo yum install php-exif
Note: If you are using a specific PHP version (e.g., PHP 8.2), the package name might be different, like php8.2-exif.

Step 2: Restart your web server
After installing the extension, you must restart your web server and PHP's FPM process for the changes to take effect.

If you are using Apache:

Bash

sudo service apache2 restart
sudo service php-fpm restart
If you are using Nginx:

Bash

sudo service nginx restart
sudo service php-fpm restart
